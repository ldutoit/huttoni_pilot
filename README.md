# Micrelenchus

## Description

### Overview

Micrelenchus is a genus of molluscs with lately unexpected phylogenetics relationships (Donald et al. 206, MPE). We have data for 4 species including outgroup).


### Key Players

Kirsten Donald 
Hamish Spencer

### What are my objectives ?

My objectives are to assemble and align mitochondria from 4 species so that Kirsten can do phylogenetics trees from them. 

The data is Illumina from PCR amplified mitochondria for 4 species. I can try to assemble them on their own. There is also one extra reference assembly from a collaborator for Micrelencus tesselatus (=Cantharidus.tesselatus.fasta).
 
### Physical location of the data

For now google drive:

### Source files
There is an excel sheet:*NGS project explanation for Ludo.xls* saying which species is which sample.Careful some samplse in the source data are for other projects.
  
The data  includes assembly done upstream with *Edena* as well as the raw reads in *NZGL02420P2* and a reference assembly 
of  the Mitochondria done in another lab for Micrelencus tesselatus (=Cantharidus.tesselatus.fasta).
